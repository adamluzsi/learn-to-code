# Learn to Code

In this repository you will see some learning materials about programming, that probably help you begin your journey.

## Introduction

This repository is sole created with the purpose to help you in begin with programming.
For those who is only about to begin programming may found hard to grasp how to start with and on what topics.
The goal here is to provide small baby steps for learning about software engineering, and collect the most necessary knowledge in one place.

The project not going to achieve the following objectives:
* Teach you specific frameworks
* keep you up to date with the current trends and hypes
* make you a software engineer by only reading this guide

The project goal is to achieve the following objectives:
* introduce you to the basic concepts of software engineering
* help you understand technologies that serve as a basis for most higher level abstraction
* help you shape your thinking to a direction which allows you do begin iterative self training
* introduce you to at least one programming language that can be used as reference for your future studies
* help you get comfortably talk with a rubber duck
