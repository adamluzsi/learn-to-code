# Learn to Code

In this repository, you will see some learning materials about programming that will probably help you begin your journey.

## Prologue

The only constant in life is change itself. Learning about how the brain works on a high level, what habits make the learning process more accessible and efficient
was a game changer in my life to improve my performance.
I will be honest, when I was a child, I had a lot of trouble with my study.
My brain assumed to have talent in one field while being bad in others.
This bias is a common assumption about programming that you must be good in math and become a software engineer.

My personal opinion is that Software Engineering can be easy and fun, but only if you learn it incrementally.
Thus, I created this guide to help others get started with this incredible profession. 

In the long run, I believe talent is insignificant in this profession.
But I believe being consequent and persistent will help you conquer your goals.
I believe that you can do it because the very fact that you are reading this now proves that you have made up your mind.
If you need help, you are welcome to contact me, and I will do my best to help you.

In the upcoming lessons, I will keep you away from too [high-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language).

I want to build a knowledge base that you can use with almost any language and tooling in the future.
But we must go through the basics, do some extra side research and exercise here and there.
For that reason, we will avoid using any framework such as a [web application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework).

Each Section below here will be a reference to a separate file that focuses on one topic.
