# As a User, I Want to Create New Notes

>   As a user of the note-taking app, 
    I want to be able to create new notes
    so that I can capture and store my thoughts and ideas.

This user story aims to enable users to create new notes in our note-taking app. 
The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to capture and store their thoughts and ideas.

**Important Note**

Don't feel overwhelmed by the scope of this task!
Creating a functional note-taking app involves several components, but we'll break it down into manageable pieces.
Our approach will be to focus on one thing at a time, and we've identified some key subtasks to help you get started.

By completing these subtasks, you'll be able to incrementally build up the functionality needed to create new notes. 
Remember to take your time, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The system allows users to create new notes with a title and content.
* The system displays the user notes in the list.
