- [ ] create tutorial for working with go `func`s and how `pass by value` and `func` arguments work.
- [ ] Create tutorial on repository pattern without abstraction:
	* Write a second tech story that introduces the repository pattern without any abstraction.
	* Have young engineers implement a simple repository pattern using an in-memory storage solution.
- [ ] Introduce abstraction to replace current solution:
	* Create a new step where users realize they are losing data due to the current solution.
	* Introduce the concept of abstraction and have young engineers replace the current solution with a file storage based one.
- [ ] Introduce IO concepts and limitations:
	* Use the file storage based solution as an opportunity to teach young engineers about IO concepts and limitations.
- [ ] Introduce web nodes running in parallel:
	* Create a new step where young engineers learn about multiple web nodes running in parallel.
	* Show how this affects the current solution (file storage) and introduce a better solution.
