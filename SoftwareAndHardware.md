# Software 'n' Hardware

So we going to be Software Engineers. But essentially, what is software in the first place ?
Back in the past, computers were made for specific tasks.
To achieve that task, they physical parts were made in a way to allow them to do so.
In other words most computer in the past were created trough [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) solutions.

Solving problems with hardware can often result in (by current technology standards) top-notch performing solutions.
An example for this because today's technology limitations is [active noise cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control).
We can build processing units that can process audio signals with in the necessary time,
and send instructions to a speaker to generate sound that will cancel the original sound waves.
But we need to do it with a hardware solution, because otherwise it would be too slow, and would result being useless.
This means in practice an actual physical chip that only purpose is to calculate inverse audio wave signals.
But to use it for anything else than this is not easily possible, if it is possible.

While I believe this is all nice, by business standards, hardware solutions are much harder to keep evolve on a system that being used actively.
For example if business goal is to create an accounting system that is specific to they company rules,
a hardware solution would be hard to keep up to date and evolve with the company.
It would even require a new computer to be created each year when requirements change.
It would sound silly to me to do such thing, how about you ?

The name itself suggest that **hard**ware is hard to change.
And this problem inspirited the need for **soft**ware.
This pushed things into a direction, where hardware manufacturers started to aim creating hardware that can perform simple tasks in an acceptable efficiently rate,
which then can be used by softwares to combine those simple task into a complex solution, which solve a specific need.
By this solving multiple problems and evolve the solution on the same hardware became reality.
Then software application solutions and hardware began to separate even more by introducing system softwares,
which goal was to provide platform for the user software applications, so user software applications can focus mainly on the needs instead of the given hardware.
You will read more about this in the Operation System section later on.

To wrap this up, software is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.
User software's goal is to achieve a task like browsing the internet, or solve math problems.
System software's goal to provide a stable platform for the user softwares make user software's independent from the hardware.

You as a software engineer will probably create user applications for business needs,
and system software infrastructure and platform needs.
