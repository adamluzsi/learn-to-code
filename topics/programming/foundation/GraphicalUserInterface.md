# Graphical User Interface

The graphical user interface (GUI /ˈɡuːi/) is a form of user interface
that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation,
instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),
which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.

Its what the user sees on the screen and how they interact with it -- buttons, menus, links, graphics, layout, animation.
Graphical User Interface, when you (the User) tap something on the screen (a Graphic (aka picture)),
the computer responds (Interface (i.e. Interaction)).

Graphical shells place a low burden on beginner computer user,
and are characterized as being easy to use.

Since they also come with certain disadvantages,
most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.
