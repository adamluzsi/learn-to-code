# GNU/Linux

GNU/Linux is a combination of the [Linux Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) and the [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).
To understand the present of the combination of this two project, we need to learn a little about the past.

## History of GNU Project

GNU goal initially was to develop a free [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operation system. This was initiated by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman).
But what is "free operation system" or ["free software"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) by 1983 standards when the project began its life ?
Back in the days, almost every software was [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software),
also known as "closed-source software", which is most of the time a non-free computer software.

This was true especially of operation systems, such as the [UNIX](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX).
In order to avoid any problem with with licensing, Richard explicitly avoided to reuse any UNIX code for the project,
and even left its current company, so they don't have any rights over the project.
Partially this could be the reason that GNU stands for “GNU's Not Unix”.

GNU project aimed compatibility with Unix, so the users of Unix was able to easily switch to GNU.
I would like to mention two component from the many that has been build under the project.
One is the [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/), and the second one is the [GNU Hurd Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd).
The design of the core utilities for GNU project was greatly inspirited by the ["Unix philosophy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
GNU Hurd failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete without a ready to use Kernel.

## History of Linux

The history of Linux began in 1991 with the commencement of a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel.
Since then, the resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history.
Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code without comments under the GNU General Public License v2.
In 1991, while studying computer science at University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the Linux kernel.
He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor.
Development was done on [MINIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX) using the GNU C Compiler.
The GNU C Compiler is still the main choice for compiling Linux today,
but can be built with other compilers, such as the Intel C Compiler.

As Torvalds wrote in his book Just for Fun, he eventually ended up writing an operating system kernel.
According to Torvalds, Linux began to gain importance in 1992 after the X Window System was ported to Linux by Orest Zborowski, which allowed Linux to support a GUI for the first time.

## GNU/Linux Today

For most cases when you hear "Linux" or "Linux distribution", it is often meant GNU/Linux,
where the GNU softwares used together with the Linux Kernel.

For development purpose I will recommend you to start get used to this development environment,
because it will boost greatly your understanding over the computer in generally.

I used windows environment a lot, before I first encountered with GNU/Linux,
and I have to say, I hated because it was way outside of my comfort zone.
But after I understood the core principles, it became my favorite choice of OS.

Also because most server environments use GNU/Linux,
it is highly recommended to practice with it beforehand on a safe environment like your PC.

There are tons of distributions these days, that are highly user friendly,
and if you can't choose what to use, I can recommend these two distribution:
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
