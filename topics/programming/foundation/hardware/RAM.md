## Understanding RAM (Random-Access Memory)

Think of RAM like your short-term memory, 
where temporary information is held.
For instance, if you learn something new today that doesn't easily connect with what you already know, 
you'll retain it for a while in your short-term memory.

The term "random" in RAM signifies that you can instantly retrieve the information stored at a particular "address"
without having to sift through all the memory.
It's like recalling the restroom code from a receipt when at the restaurant door; 
you don’t have to sift through all your memories, 
just think "restroom code from the receipt" and there it is.
This feature makes short-term memory (or RAM) faster and easier to use for both our brains and computers, 
compared to long-term memory.

However, the information in RAM disappears if the power goes off 
or the device restarts because RAM needs electricity to retain data.

## RAM Clock Speed (MHz)

The MHz (Megahertz) in RAM refers to the maximum number of cycles it can perform in a second.
With Double Data Rate (DDR) RAM, 
communication happens twice per cycle, 
which is why chips are now labeled by bandwidth, 
not just frequency.
Yet, knowing the clock rate is essential to ensure compatibility with your motherboard/CPU.

For example, 
a 200 MHz DDR (PC-3200) RAM operates like so:
> 200 MHz clock rate × 2 (as it's DDR, or 1 for SDR) × 8 Bytes = 3,200 MB/s bandwidth.
