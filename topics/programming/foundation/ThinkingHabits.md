# Thinking Habits

Here, in this page, each following section will describe one habit that can change your thinking and learning potential.
For now, you just going to read them, and in the upcoming lesions, I advise you to try apply them on your studies.

## Grounding your thinking

* Understand simple things deeply.
* Clear the clutter
* See what’s there
* See what’s missing
* Master the basics first
* Challenge of your current knowledge

When you want to learn something, don't focus on reaching from A to B as fast as possible.
Instead, try to learn about the context of A, and incrementally learn intermediate subjects as well that eventually lead to B.
By building context during your studies, you brain will be able to build connections between already known things and the new subject.
This will dramatically increase the speed of remembering and memorization of a new subject, because we use one of the strongest property of our brain, which is pattern matching.
And while this can dramatically increase the speed of your learning process, it also help you reduce a negative side effect which also came from the pattern matching property.
And this side effect is that if the brain lack contextual information, it will still try to desperately find pattern between the already known knowledge and the new subject.

One example is that In Quantum Computing, if you try to understand how things works, without first building knowledge about the context,
you more likely will make an assumption how it might works based on things you already know.

My thumb of rule here is to look up anything during a study of a new subject, that is currently unknown.
Don't allow your brain to make assumptions what could be the missing puzzle,
because than you risk the chance of making a false assumption.

## Igniting Insights through Mistakes

* Fail to succeed
* Welcome accidental missteps, let your errors be your guide
* Finding the right question to the wrong answer
* Failing by intent

Fear is a natural feeling. When we make mistakes, we fear from consequences, and thus sometimes,
we are paralyzed from begin something. I not going to lie. This fear will always be part of the human nature.
Especially the fear from the unknown. But this doesn't mean this feeling is objective or unerring.
And for most of the case, you will see in the future, that by making mistakes,
it is not about that we made that mistake, but all about what we learned from it.
At certain point, you even begin to see mistakes as opportunity for making things better by learning from them.

As I write this guide, I'm 100% sure that I make terrible mistakes in multiple perspective.
Am I worried about it ? Absolutely ! Does it good reason to not do it then ? No .
Because I feel that even making mistakes, I will still have chance to make it better,
and there is always a chance that this time I spend writing this guide could potentially help someone in the future.

While this is all sound nice, I understand that not every environment welcome mistakes in such way.
That's why this is all about you and how you going to handle your mistake.
I personally believe that when I do mistake, I should communicate it with anyone who could benefit from my mistake as well.
Trough this, I don't try to hide my mistakes but try to use it as a learning possibility.

My thumb of rule here is to challenge the feeling of fear by thinking over the worst case scenarios.
One of my favorite thought for handling most of my fear is the following:

    What is the worst thing that could happen ?
    I die...
    but it's unlikely to happen if I do this.

Somehow this funny thought usually enough to make it feel bagatelle most of my fear.

## Creating Questions out of Thin Air

* How answers can lead to questions
* Creating questions enlivens your curiosity
* Ask meta-questions.
* When in doubt, ask.

Asking sometimes hard. Subconsciously we fear from others opinion about us,
and thus try to avoid any scenario that could lead to make your image look bad.
This is something that most people do, most of the time without intention.
One such scenario is when we try to make our self stand out at a new workplace,
and someone is telling us information about various different things,
and suddenly you realize, you have no idea about some basic things that seems natural to others around you.
You than feel that you should avoid being look "dumb" and you make note about it to look it up later.
You try to look up later, and you not able to find anything relevant about it.
You just had your first encounter with [Curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).
Sometimes what seems common knowledge that you still don't know, can easily be a knowledge that is domain specific to that company,
or just simply used slightly differently than you had learned. Asking questions in such situation can easily eliminate misunderstandings.

And that is just one aspect of asking questions. Other aspects can involve the fear of making others felt challenged, tested which can easily lead to tension.
Regardless of this, I still believe asking questions is the a great tool to reduce communication hiccups, and use the moment for learning opportunity.
I even ask questions from myself as well, when I think about something, and I feel uncertainty about my knowledge.
In fact I so much like to practice asking questions that I stopped feel any shame even for asking basic things if I don't know it.
As a nice side effect, people feel confidence in your knowledge, if you ask questions when you need it.

My thumb or rule for this is: when in doubt, ask.

## Seeing the Flow of Ideas

* Understanding current ideas through the flow of ideas
* Creating new ideas from old ones
* Iterate ideas
* Extend ideas
* Learn about the past of an idea to understand the present and future

New ideas today are built on the ideas of yesterday and illuminate the way to the brilliant ideas of tomorrow.
Each new idea extends a line that started in the past and travels through the present into the future.
Successful and effective learners and innovators harness the power of the flow of ideas,
There’s always more: every advance can be the launchpad to far greater advances yet to be discovered.
A personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel was an idea,
that evolved into its current state where almost every company in IT use it for servers.
Solutions to little problems generate solutions to great problems.

When you have idea, or you feel genuinely interested about a hobby/side project don't hesitate to think about doing it.
Even if the goal seems tremendous, the only person who needs to move it forward a little by little is you.
Take that goal that you’re facing and quickly just do it. Don't try to aim for perfection, just begin to work on it.
Iterate over your current work by choosing to improve one small step on it, and learn from the mistakes you do.

I found a lot of joy, career and personal development as well during my time of working on my side projects.

## Summary

    "Strive for rock-solid understanding.
    Fail and learn from those missteps.
    Constantly create and ask challenging questions.
    Consciously consider the flow of ideas.
    And, of course, remember that learning is a lifelong journey;
    thus each of us remains a work-in-progress,
    always evolving, ever changing,
    and that’s Quintessential living."

## Resources

While I learned this trough the hard way, I happen to found a book that correlate with my personal experiences almost 1:1.
The book name is [5 element of effective thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6VCaNqK66s),
and I can really suggest it to
