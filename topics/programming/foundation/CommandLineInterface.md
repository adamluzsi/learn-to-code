# Command Line Interface

A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI),
also known as command-line user interface, console user interface and character user interface (CUI),
is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program
in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).

A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter.
The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems on computer terminals in the mid-1960s,
and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on OpenVMS,
Unix systems and personal computer systems including MS-DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS.

The interface is usually implemented with a command line shell,
which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.

Today, many end users rarely, if ever, use command-line interfaces and instead rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions.
However, many software developers, system administrators and advanced users still rely heavily on command-line interfaces to perform tasks more efficiently,
configure their machine, or access programs and program features that are not available through a graphical interface.

Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.

## Windows

The most popular shells being used are
* [Windows Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
* [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe)

## Unix-like environments

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a t;
however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell are common for server systems.

The currently most popular shells are:
* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
  * usually can be found on most GNU/Linux environments
* [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
  * A user community website called "Oh My Zsh" collects third-party plug-ins and themes for the Z shell. As of 2018, their GitHub repository has (of varying quality):
    * over 1,000 contributors
    * over 200 plug-ins
    * over 140 themes
    * It also comes with an auto-update tool that makes it easier to keep installed plug-ins and themes updated
* [fish / friendly interactive shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_interactive_shell)
* [ksh / KornShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell)

All Unix shells provide:
* [filename wildcarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character)
* [piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))
* [here documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document)
* [command substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_substitution)
* [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming))
* [control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) for [condition-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(programming))
* [iteration capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)
