# Technical Story

A technical story, also known as a technical task or tech debt story, is a work item focused on implementing a specific technical solution or resolving a technical issue. It captures the technical aspects of a project in a concise and actionable format.

Technical stories also introduce intermediate steps that can be tackled separately, making it easier to manage large user stories.

## Why do we need technical stories?

Technical stories are essential because they help developers:

1. **Improve code quality**: By addressing technical debt, refactoring code, or implementing new technologies.
2. **Enhance system performance**: By optimizing database queries, improving caching mechanisms, or reducing latency.
3. **Ensure security and compliance**: By implementing security patches, updating dependencies, or configuring access controls.

## Key characteristics:

1. **Technical focus**: Written from a technical perspective, often using specialized terms and jargon.
2. **Specific solution-oriented**: Clearly defines the technical approach to be taken to resolve an issue or implement a feature.
3. **Typically smaller scope**: Compared to user stories, which may require multiple technical stories to deliver.

## Example:

"Implement caching mechanism for product search results using Redis to improve page load times."

This example illustrates a basic technical story structure:

* "Implement [technical solution]" (describes the specific approach)
* "[Technical detail]" (provides context or specifies the technology used)
* "to [achieve some benefit]" (explains the reason behind the request)

## Relationship with user stories:

User stories often rely on one or more technical stories to deliver the desired functionality. Technical stories can be considered as sub-tasks or implementation details that help achieve the goals outlined in a user story.

For instance, the user story "As a customer, I want to search for products by name or description so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for" might rely on several technical stories, such as:

* Implementing a search algorithm
* Indexing product data in a database
* Caching search results using Redis (as shown above)
