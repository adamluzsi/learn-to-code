# Epic

An epic is a large user story or a collection of related user stories that share a common theme, goal, or objective. Epics are used to group smaller user stories together into a larger narrative, providing context and structure for the development team.

## Why do we need epics?

Epics help developers:
1. **Organize complex projects**: By breaking down large initiatives into manageable chunks.
2. **Provide context**: By grouping related user stories together, making it easier to understand the bigger picture.
3. **Prioritize work**: By focusing on high-level goals and objectives.

## Key characteristics:

1. **High-level goal**: Epics represent a significant objective or outcome that requires multiple user stories to achieve.
2. **Collection of user stories**: Epics are composed of several related user stories that contribute to the overall goal.
3. **Longer-term focus**: Epics often span multiple sprints, releases, or iterations.


## Example:

"Implement e-commerce functionality for online store"

This epic might include several user stories, such as:

* "As a customer, I want to view product details so that I can make informed purchasing decisions."
* "As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart so that I can purchase them later."
* "As a customer, I want to checkout securely using credit card or PayPal."

In this example, the epic "Implement e-commerce functionality for online store" represents a high-level goal that requires multiple user stories to achieve.

## Relationship with user stories and technical stories:

User stories are the building blocks of epics. Technical stories may be created to support the development of specific user stories within an epic.

Think of it like this:
* Epic: High-level goal (e.g., "Implement e-commerce functionality for online store")
	+ User Story 1: View product details
		- Technical Story 1: Implement product detail page template
		- Technical Story 2: Retrieve product data from database
	+ User Story 2: Add products to shopping cart
		- Technical Story 3: Create shopping cart API endpoint

By using epics, you can create a hierarchical structure that helps teams understand the relationships between user stories and technical tasks.
