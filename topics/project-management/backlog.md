# Backlog

A backlog is a collection of work items, such as user stories, technical stories, epics, or defects, that are waiting to be prioritized, estimated, and worked on by the development team.

## Why do we need a backlog?

A backlog serves several purposes:
1. **Central repository**: It provides a single source of truth for all work items, making it easier to manage and track progress.
2. **Prioritization**: The backlog allows teams to prioritize work items based on their relative importance and urgency.
3. **Transparency**: It provides visibility into the upcoming work, enabling stakeholders to plan and make informed decisions.

## Key characteristics:

1. **Dynamic list**: The backlog is a constantly evolving list of work items, with new items being added and old ones being completed or removed.
2. **Prioritized**: Work items in the backlog are prioritized based on their importance, complexity, and other factors.
3. **Estimated**: Each work item in the backlog typically has an estimate associated with it, indicating the effort required to complete it.

## Example:

A development team's backlog might contain:
* User Story 1: Implement search functionality (estimated at 8 points)
* Epic: Develop mobile app for iOS and Android (contains multiple user stories)
* Technical Story: Upgrade database schema to support new features
* Defect: Fix issue with login page

The backlog is often divided into different sections, such as:
* **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of work items that are related to the product or project.
* **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog that contains the work items selected for a specific sprint or iteration.
* **Release Backlog**: A collection of work items that need to be completed before a release can occur.

## Relationship with epics, user stories, and technical stories:

Epics, user stories, and technical stories are all types of work items that can be included in the backlog. The backlog provides context for these work items, allowing teams to prioritize and manage them effectively.

Think of it like this:

* Backlog: Collection of work items (e.g., user stories, epics, technical stories)
	+ Epic: Implement e-commerce functionality
		- User Story 1: View product details
		- User Story 2: Add products to shopping cart
	+ Technical Story: Upgrade database schema
