# Installation

Install and configure your Go toolchain.

## From Source

- Download the latest Go binary for your OS from https://go.dev/dl
- Choose based on your system's OS and architecture type

**Linux example**:

```sh
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Make sure your shell's `PATH` environment variable points to add the installation directory to your shell environment,
by updating your `.bashrc` / `.bash_profile` / `.profile` file.
[If you don't get this part, don't worry, you can read more about it here.](/topics/programming/foundation/shell/cli/EnvironmentVariables.md)
[If shell itself is new to you, then you can read more about it here.](/topics/programming/foundation/CommandLineInterface.md)

```sh
PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin"
export PATH
```
